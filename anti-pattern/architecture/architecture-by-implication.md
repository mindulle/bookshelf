# Architecture By Implication {#architecture-by-implication .title}




-   **AntiPattern Name:** Architecture by Implication
-   **Also Known As:** Wherefore art thou architecture?
-   **Most Frequent Scale:** System
-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Goal Question Architecture
-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Documentation
-   **Root Causes:** Pride, Sloth
-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Complexity, Change, and Risk
-   **Anecdotal Evidence:** \"We\'ve done systems like this before!\"
    \"There is no risk; we know what we\'re doing!\"

### Background

Dwight Eisenhower said that planning is essential, but plans are
inconsequential. Another soldier said that no plans survive first
contact with the enemy. The planning culture in modern management owes
some credit to Robert McNamara, founder of the RAND Corporation.

In McNamara\'s approach, plans are generated for speculative purposes,
to investigate the potential benefits and consequences of different
courses of action. Given the large number of unknowns in systems
development, planning for IT systems must be more pragmatic and
iterative.

One professional planner said that 20 percent of an engineer\'s time
should be devoted to planning. As we gain experience, our belief in this
assertion increases. Productivity and efficiency can be greatly
amplified when the work is well organized through planning.

The unfortunate consequence is that many organizations attempt to
formalize too much of the planning. Planning is most effective when it
is personally motivated and utilized. Time management experts teach that
a key element of stress reduction is planning to balance life\'s overall
priorities. The form and use of time-management systems becomes
increasingly personalized as the practice matures.

A group of CEOs from DoD Systems integration firms was formed to answer
the question, \"Wherefore art thou architecture?\" The goal was to
reflect on the changing nature of systems development, which has evolved
into the reuse of existing legacy components and commercial software,
and away from greenfield, custom code development (see the Reinvent the
Wheel AntiPattern).

### General Form

This AntiPattern is characterized by the lack of architecture
specifications for a system under development. Usually, the architects
responsible for the project have experience with previous system
construction, and therefore assume that documentation is unnecessary.

This overconfidence leads to exacerbated risks in key areas that affect
system success. Architecture definitions are often missing from one or
more of these areas:

-   Software architecture and specifications that include language use,
    library use, coding standards, memory management, and so forth.
-   Hardware architecture that includes client and service
    configurations.
-   Communications architecture that includes networking protocols and
    devices.
-   Persistence architecture that includes databases and file-handling
    mechanisms.
-   Application security architecture that includes thread models and
    trusted system base.
-   Systems management architecture.

### Symptoms And Consequences

-   Lack of architecture planning and specification; insufficient
    definition of architecture for software, hardware, communications,
    persistence, security, and systems management.
-   Hidden risks caused by scale, domain knowledge, technology, and
    complexity, all of which emerge as the project progresses.
-   Impending project failure or unsuccessful system due to inadequate
    performance, excess complexity, misunderstood requirements,
    usability, and other system characteristics. For example,
    approximately 1 of 3 systems encounter serious performance problems
    during development and operations.
-   Ignorance of new technologies.
-   Absence of technical backup and contingency plans.

### Typical Causes

-   No risk management.
-   Overconfidence of managers, architects, and/or developers.
-   Reliance on previous experience, which may differ in critical areas.
-   Implicit and unresolved architecture issues caused by gaps in
    systems engineering.

### Known Exceptions

The Architecture by Implication AntiPattern is acceptable for a repeated
solution, where there are minor differences in the code, such as
installation scripts. This AntiPattern may also be useful in a new
project domain as an exploratory effort to determine whether existing
techniques are transferable into a new area.

### Refactored Solution

The refactored solution to the Architecture by Implication AntiPattern
entails an organized approach to systems architecture definition, and
relies on multiple views of the system. Each view models the system from
the perspective of a system stakeholder, who may be real or imaginary,
individual or aggregate. Each stakeholder is responsible for a
high-priority set of questions and issues, and each view represents the
entire information system and answers these key questions and issues.

The views comprising a set of diagrams, tables, or specifications, are
linked for consistency. Generally, a view is a lightweight
specification. The purpose of the architecture documentation is to
communicate architecture decisions and other issues resolutions. The
documentation should be easy to understand and inexpensive to maintain.

That said, the only people who can define and implement a successful
architecture are those who already fully understand it. Unfortunately,
this is often not the case, as many projects adopt some new technology
that is not well understood. Therefore, developing a good architecture
from scratch is an iterative process and should be recognized as such.

An initial reference architecture should have strong strategies that can
be implemented within the time period of the first product development.
Thereafter, it will have to be incrementally refined by future versions
of the reference architecture, and driven by new versions of the first
product or new products.

The steps to define a system architecture using viewpoints are as
follows :

1.  *Define the architecture goals.* What must this architecture
    achieve? Which stakeholders, real and imaginary, must be satisfied
    with the design and implementation? What is the vision for the
    system? Where are we now and where are we going?
2.  *Define the questions.* What are the specific questions that must be
    addressed to satisfy the stakeholder issues? Prioritize the
    questions to support view selection.
3.  *Select the views.* Each view will represent a blueprint of the
    system architecture.
4.  *Analyze each view.* Detail the architecture definition from each
    viewpoint. Create the system blueprints.
5.  *Integrate the blueprints.* Verify that the views present a
    consistent architecture definition.
6.  *Trace views to needs.* The views should address the known questions
    and issues to discover any gaps not addressed by the architecture
    specifications. Validate the architecture with respect to formal
    requirements. Prioritize the outstanding issues.
7.  *Iterate the blueprints.* Refine the views until all questions,
    issues, and gaps are resolved. Utilize review processes to surface
    any remaining issues. If a significant number of unresolved issues
    remain, consider creating additional views.
8.  *Promote the architecture.* Make an explicit effort to communicate
    the architecture to key stakeholders, particularly the system
    developers. Create lasting documents (such as a video tutorial) to
    provide valuable information throughout the development and
    maintenance life cycle.
9.  *Validate the implementation.* The blueprints should represent an
    \"as-built\" design. Determine any deltas between the blueprints and
    the system implementation. Decide whether these differences should
    result in system modifications of updates to the blueprints. Upgrade
    the documentation for consistency.

We refer to this method as the goal-question architecture (GQA),
analogous to the goal-question metric approach in software metrics

### Variations

A number of approaches consider the system architecture using
viewpoints; in some, the viewpoints are predefined. Most of these
approaches are open-ended, in that one can select additional viewpoints
as described.

The Reference Model for Open Distributed Process (RM-ODP) is a popular,
useful standard for distributed architectures. RM-ODP defines five
standard viewpoints: enterprise, information, computational,
engineering, and technology It also defines a useful set of transparency
properties for distributed infrastructure through the engineering
viewpoint.

Another approach, the Zachman Framework, analyzes system architectures
from the perspectives of data, function, and network Within each
perspective are multiple levels of abstraction, corresponding to the
planning needs of various groups of stakeholders. Enterprise
Architecture Planning is an approach based upon the Zachman Framework
for large-scale systems Neither of these approaches is tailored to
object-oriented systems development.

A third approach, the Command, Communication, Control, Computer,
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Architecture Framework
(C4ISR-AF), is used to define various command and control system
architectures. A version of C4ISR-AF is used for other types of civilian
systems. This approach has been very beneficial in enabling
communications between architects across disparate domains

A fourth, the 4 + 1 Model View, is a viewpoint-based architecture
approach supported by software engineering tools, such as Rational Rose
The viewpoints include logical, use-case, process, implementation, and
deployment. Finally, GQA is a generalization of the underlying method
used in several of these architecture approaches

### Example

A common but bad practice is object-oriented modeling without defining
the viewpoint. In most modeling approaches, there is a blurring of the
viewpoints. Many of the modeling constructs contain implementation
detail, and the default practice is to intermingle implementation and
specification constructs.

Three fundamental viewpoints are: conceptual, specification, and
implementation The *conceptual viewpoint* defines the system from the
perspective of the user. This is typically referred to as an *analysis
model.* The distinction between what is automated and what is not is
usually not represented in the model; rather, the model is drawn so that
a user can explain and defend it to his or her peers.

The *specification viewpoint* concerns only interfaces. ISO IDL is one
important notation that is strictly limited to defining interface
information and excludes implementation specifics. The separation of
interfaces from implementations enables the realization of many
important object technology benefits, such as reuse, system extension,
variation, substitutability, polymorphism, and distributed object
computing. The final viewpoint, *implementation,* is best represented by
the source code.

Complex implementation structures are beneficially augmented with
object-oriented design models to help current and future developers and
maintainers understand the code.

Another example of the Architecture by Implication AntiPattern is the
following, where the key stakeholders did not have collective experience
in what was built. The project was intended to deliver a Microsoft
Distributed Common Object Model (DCOM)-based solution to extract legacy
mainframe data, filter it based on business rule, and display it on Web
pages.

However, the manager was a good software engineer with no distributed
object technology (DOT) experience and the architect was a
\"dyed-in-the-wool\" CORBA addict who helped the OMG derive its Object
Management Architecture. To compound the problem, the project had few
DCOM-aware staff; less than 10 percent.

In addition, the architecture and subsequent design were based on the
OMA view of the DOT world, rather than DCOM. This led to an attempt to
deliver CORBA services under a DCOM architecture. The resulting product
suffered from a set of components that had no DOT consistency and were
poor performers. Also, SIs found it very difficult to use, due to lack
of a standardized approach. Finally, it failed in the marketplace.

### Related Solutions

Architecture by Implication AntiPattern differs from the Stovepipe
Systems AntiPattern in scope; the latter focuses on deficiencies in
computational architecture. In particular, it identifies how improper
abstraction of subsystem APIs leads to brittle architecture solutions.
In contrast, the Architecture by Implication AntiPattern involves
planning gaps constituted of multiple architecture viewpoints.

### Applicability To Other Viewpoints And Scales

This AntiPattern significantly increases risk for managers, who defer
important decisions until failures occur; often, it is too late to
recover. Developers suffer from a lack of guidance for system
implementation.

They are given de facto responsibility for key architectural decisions
for which they may not have the necessary architectural perspective.
Systemwide consequences of interface design decisions should be
considered; in particular: system adaptability, consistent interface
abstractions, metadata availability, and management of complexity.

Another important result of this AntiPattern is the deferment of
resource allocation. The essential tools and technology components may
not be available when needed due to lack of planning.
