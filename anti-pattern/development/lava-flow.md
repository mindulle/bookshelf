# Lava Flow {#lava-flow .title}




-   **AntiPattern Name:** Lava Flow
-   **Also Known As:** Dead Code
-   **Most Frequent Scale:** Application
-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Architectural Configuration Management
-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Process
-   **Root Causes:** Avarice, Greed, Sloth
-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Functionality, Performance,
    Complexity
-   **Anecdotal Evidence:** \"Oh *that!* Well Ray and Emil (they\'re no
    longer with the company) wrote that routine back when Jim (who left
    last month) was trying a workaround for Irene\'s input processing
    code (she\'s in another department now, too). I don\'t think it\'s
    used anywhere now, but I\'m not really sure. Irene didn\'t really
    document it very clearly, so we figured we would just leave well
    enough alone for now. After all, the bloomin\' thing works doesn\'t
    it?!\"

### Background

In a data-mining expedition, we began looking for insight into
developing a standard interface for a particular kind of system. The
system we were mining was very similar to those we hoped would
eventually support the standard we were working on. It was also a
research-originated system and highly complex. As we delved into it, we
interviewed many of the developers concerning certain components of the
massive number of pages of code printed out for us.

Over and over, we got the same answer: \"I don\'t know what that class
is for; it was written before I got here.\" We gradually realized that
between 30 and 50 percent of the actual code that comprised this complex
system was not understood or documented by any one currently working on
it.

Furthermore, as we analyzed it, we learned that the questionable code
really served no purpose in the current system; rather, it was there
from previous attempts or approaches by long-gone developers. The
current staff, while very bright, was loath to modify or delete code
that they didn\'t write or didn\'t know the purpose of, for fear of
breaking something and not knowing why or how to fix it.

At this point, we began calling these blobs of code \"lava,\" referring
to the fluid nature in which they originated as compared to the
basaltlike hardness and difficulty in removing it once it had
solidified. Suddenly, it dawned on us that we had identified a potential
AntiPattern.

Nearly a year later, and after several more data-mining expeditions and
interface design efforts, we had encountered the same pattern so
frequently that we were routinely referring to Lava Flow throughout the
department.

### General Form

The Lava Flow AntiPattern is commonly found in systems that originated
as research but ended up in production. It is characterized by the
lavalike \"flows\" of previous developmental versions strewn about the
code landscape, which have now hardened into a basaltlike, immovable,
generally useless mass of code that no one can remember much, if
anything, about.

This is the result of earlier (perhaps Jurassic) developmental times
when, while in a research mode, developers tried out several ways of
accomplishing things, typically in a rush to deliver some kind of
demonstration, thereby casting sound design practices to the winds and
sacrificing documentation.

``` {.code lang="java"}
// This class was written by someone earlier (Alex?) to manager the indexing
// or something (maybe). It's probably important. Don't delete. I don't think it's
// used anywhere - at least not in the new MacroINdexer module which may
// actually replace whatever this was used for.
class IndexFrame extends Frame {
  // IndexFrame constructor
  // ---------------------------
  public IndexFrame(String index_parameter_1)
  {
    // Note: need to add additional stuff here...
    super (str);
  }
  // ---------------------------
```

The result is several fragments of code, wayward variable classes, and
procedures that are not clearly related to the overall system. In fact,
these flows are often so complicated in appearance and spaghettilike
that they seem important, but no one can really explain what they do or
why they exist.

Sometimes, an old, gray-haired hermit developer can remember certain
details, but typically, everyone has decided to \"leave well enough
alone\" since the code in question \"doesn\'t really cause any harm, and
might actually be critical, and we just don\'t have time to mess with
it.\"

Though it can be fun to dissect these flows and study their
anthropology, there is usually not enough time in the schedule for such
meanderings. Instead, developers usually take the expedient route and
neatly work around them.

This AntiPattern is, however, incredibly common in innovative design
shops where proof-of-concept or prototype code rapidly moves into
production. It is poor design, for several key reasons:

-   Lava Flows are expensive to analyze, verify, and test. All such
    effort is expended entirely in vain and is an absolute waste. In
    practice, verification and test are rarely possible.
-   Lava Flow code can be expensive to load into memory, wasting
    important resources and impacting performance.
-   As with many AntiPatterns, you lose many of the inherent advantages
    of an object-oriented design. In this case, you lose the ability to
    leverage modularization and reuse without further proliferating the
    Lava Flow globules.

### Symptoms And Consequences

-   Frequent unjustifiable variables and code fragments in the system.
-   Undocumented complex, important-looking functions, classes, or
    segments that don\'t clearly relate to the system architecture.
-   Very loose, \"evolving\" system architecture.
-   Whole blocks of commented-out code with no explanation or
    documentation.
-   Lots of \"in flux\" or \"to be replaced\" code areas.
-   Unused (dead) code, just left in.
-   Unused, inexplicable, or obsolete interfaces located in header
    files.
-   If existing Lava Flow code is not removed, it can continue to
    proliferate as code is reused in other areas.
-   If the process that leads to Lava Flow is not checked, there can be
    exponential growth as succeeding developers, too rushed or
    intimidated to analyze the original flows, continue to produce new,
    secondary flows as they try to work around the original ones, this
    compounds the problem.
-   As the flows compound and harden, it rapidly becomes impossible to
    document the code or understand its architecture enough to make
    improvements.

### Typical Causes

-   R&D code placed into production without thought toward configuration
    management.
-   Uncontrolled distribution of unfinished code. Implementation of
    several trial approaches toward implementing some functionality.
-   Single-developer (lone wolf) written code.
-   Lack of configuration management or compliance with process
    management policies.
-   Lack of architecture, or non-architecture-driven development. This
    is especially prevalent with highly transient development teams.
-   Repetitive development process. Often, the goals of the software
    project are unclear or change repeatedly. To cope with the changes,
    the project must rework, backtrack, and develop prototypes. In
    response to demonstration deadlines, there is a tendency to make
    hasty changes to code on the fly to deal with immediate problems.
    The code is never cleaned up, leaving architectural consideration
    and documentation postponed indefinitely.
-   Architectural scars. Sometimes, architectural commitments that are
    made during requirements analysis are found not to work after some
    amount of development. The system architecture may be reconfigured,
    but these inline mistakes are seldom removed. It may not even be
    feasible to comment-out unnecessary code, especially in modern
    development environments where hundreds of individual files comprise
    the code of a system. \"Who\'s going to look in all those files?
    Just link em in!\"

### Known Exceptions

Small-scale, throwaway prototypes in an R&D environment are ideally
suited for implementing the Lava Flow AntiPattern. It is essential to
deliver rapidly, and the result is not required to be sustainable.

### Refactored Solution

There is only one sure-fire way to prevent the Lava Flow AntiPattern:
Ensure that sound architecture precedes production code development.
This architecture must be backed up by a configuration management
process that ensures architectural compliance and accommodates \"mission
creep\" (changing requirements).

If architectural consideration is shortchanged up front, ultimately,
code is developed that is not a part of the target architecture, and is
therefore redundant or dead. Over time, dead code becomes problematic
for analysis, testing, and revision.

In cases where Lava Flow already exists, the cure can be painful. An
important principle is to avoid architecture changes during active
development. In particular, this applies to computational architecture,
the software interfaces defining the systems integration solution.
Management must postpone development until a clear architecture has been
defined and disseminated to developers.

Defining the architecture may require one or more system discovery
activities. System discovery is required to locate the components that
are really used and necessary to the system. System discovery also
identifies those lines of code that can be safely deleted. This activity
is tedious; it can require the investigative skills of an experienced
software detective.

As suspected dead code is eliminated, bugs are introduced. When this
happens, resist the urge to immediately fix the symptoms without fully
understanding the cause of the error. Study the dependencies. This will
help you to better define the target architecture.

To avoid Lava Flow, it is important to establish system-level software
interfaces that are stable, well-defined, and clearly documented.
Investment up front in quality software interfaces can produce big
dividends in the long run compared to the cost of jackhammering away
hardened globules of Lava Flow code.

Tools such as the Source-Code Control System (SCCS) assist in
configuration management. SCCS is bundled with most Unix environments
and provides a basic capability to record histories of updates to
configuration-controlled files.

### Example

We recently participated in a data-mining expedition site where we
attempted to identify evolutionary interfaces that resulted from
preliminary interface architectures that we originated and were in the
process of updating.

The system we mined was targeted because the developers had utilized our
initial architecture in a unique way that fascinated us: Essentially,
they constructed a quasi-event service out of our generic
interapplication framework.

As we studied their system, we encountered large segments of code that
baffled us. These segments didn\'t seem to contribute to the overall
architecture that we had expected to find. They were somewhat incohesive
and only very sparsely documented, if at all.

When we asked the current developers about some of these segments, the
reply was, \"Oh that? Well we\'re not using that approach anymore.
Reggie was trying something, but we came up with a better way. I guess
some of Reggie\'s other code may depend on that stuff though, so we
didn\'t delete anything.\" As we looked deeper into the matter, we
learned that Reggie was no longer even at the site, and hadn\'t been
there for some time, so the segments of code were several months old.

After two days of code examination, we realized that the majority of the
code that comprised the system was most likely similar to that code that
we already examined: completely Lava Flow in nature.

We gleaned very little that helped us articulate how their architecture
actually was constructed; therefore, it was nearly impossible to mine.
At this point, we essentially gave up trying to mine the code and
instead focused on the current developer\'s explanations of what was
\"really\" going on, hoping to somehow codify their work into interface
extensions that we could incorporate into our upcoming revisions to our
generic interapplication framework.

One solution was to isolate the single, key person who best understood
the system they had developed, and then to jointly write IDL with that
person. On the surface, the purpose of the IDL we were jointly writing
was to support a crisis demonstration that was weeks away.

By utilizing the Fire Drill Mini-AntiPattern, we were able to get the
systems developers to validate our IDL by using it to rapidly build a
CORBA wrapper for their product for the demonstration. Many people lost
a lot of sleep, but the demonstration went well. There was, of course,
one side effect to this solution: We ended up with the interface, in
IDL, which we had set out to discover in the first place.

### Related Solutions

In today\'s competitive world, it is often desirable to minimize the
time delay between R&D and production. In many industries, this is
critical to a company\'s survival. Where this is the case, inoculation
against Lava Flow can sometimes be found in a customized
configuration-management (CM) process that puts certain limiting
controls in place at the prototyping stage, similar to \"hooks\" into a
real, production-class develop ment without the full restraining impact
on the experimental nature of R&D.

Where possible, automation can play a big role here, but the key lies in
the customization of a quasi-CM process that can be readily scaled into
a full-blown CM control system once the product moves into a production
environment. The issue is one of balance between the costs of CM in
hampering the creative process and the cost of rapidly gaining CM
control of the development once that creative process has birthed
something useful and marketable.

This approach can be facilitated by periodic mapping of a prototyping
system into an updated system architecture, including limited, but
standardized inline documentation of the code.

### Applicability To Other Viewpoints And Scales

The architectural viewpoint plays a key role in preventing Lava Flows
initially. Managers can also play a role in early identification of Lava
Flows or the circumstances that can lead to Lava Flows. These managers
must also have the authority to put the brakes on when Lava Flow is
first identified, postponing further development until a clear
architecture can be defined and disseminated.

As with most AntiPatterns, prevention is always cheaper than correction,
so up-front investment in good architecture and team education can
typically ensure a project against this and most other AntiPatterns.
While this initial cost does not show immediate returns, it is certainly
a good investment.
