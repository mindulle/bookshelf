# Corncob {#corncob .title}




-   **AntiPattern Name:** Corncob
-   **Also Known As:** Corporate Shark, Loose Cannon, Third-World
    Information Systems Troubles (TWIT)
-   **Most Frequent Scale:** Enterprise
-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Corncob Removal Service
-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Role
-   **Root Causes:** Avarice, Pride, Narrow-Mindedness
-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Resources, Technology Transfer
-   **Anecdotal Evidence:** \"Why is Bill so difficult to work with?\"
    \"Management always listens to whomever shouts longest and
    loudest.\" \"I own development and I have made a decision that you
    will follow.\" \"We need to change the build process and accept that
    we will delay delivery a month or two.\"

### Background

Corncobs are difficult people who can be prevalent in the software
development business. This attitude can be due to aspects of individual
personality, but often, difficulties arise from personal motivations for
recognition or monetary incentives.

Due to rigorous schedules and budget pressure, software development can
become stressful. Corncobs exacerbate these problems and create
unnecessary, additional stress, in what may be an already overstressed
environment.

\"Corncob\" is a slang term frequently used at Object Management Group,
a software consortium, to describe difficult people.

### General Form

A difficult person (the Corncob) causes problems through destructive
behaviors for a software development team or, even worse, throughout an
enterprise. This person may be a member of the team or a member of
external senior staff (such as a technical architect or development
manager) who adversely impacts the team through various means:
technical, political, and personal.

When dealing with Corncobs, it\'s important to remember that politics is
the exercise of power, and Corncobs focus much more on politics than
technology. They are usually experts at manipulating politics at
personal and/or organizational levels. Technology-focused people can
become unwilling easy victims of the Corncob\'s tactics.

### Symptoms And Consequences

-   A development team or project is unable to make progress because
    someone disagrees with their key objectives or essential processes
    and continually tries to change them.
-   One person continually raises objections, under the guise of
    concern, which are intractable: performance, reliability, technology
    market share, and so on.
-   The destructive behavior is well known to many people in the
    enterprise, but it\'s tolerated and supported (in some way) by
    management because they are unaware of, or unwilling to address, the
    damage it causes.
-   Political forces create an environment where it\'s difficult to keep
    technical discussions on track.
-   Political forces result in frequent changes to the scope or
    requirements of the system. The project becomes much more reactive
    than proactive, because everyone is responding to the \"endless
    improvements\" from the Corncob.
-   Often, the destructive person is a manager who is not under the
    direct authority of a senior software development manager or project
    manager.
-   The company has no defined decision-making process that enables it
    to resolve issues and move on. This allows a manager to
    inappropriately interfere beyond his or her area of accountability.

### Typical Causes

Management supports the Corncob\'s destructive behavior, by virtue of
not acknowledging the impact of the Corncob\'s actions. Management\'s
view of the situation is often supplied from the Corncob.

-   The Corncob has a hidden agenda, which conflicts with the team\'s
    goals.
-   There is a fundamental disagreement between team members that no
    amount of communication can resolve.
-   Management doesn\'t isolate the group from internal and external
    forces, and has inappropriately allocated roles to staff, who abuse
    them for their own ends; even worse, management has failed to
    allocate accountability at all.

### Known Exceptions

The Corncob AntiPattern is acceptable when a company or product
development manager is willing to live with the actions of the Corncob.
This is a subjective judgment of benefits and disadvantages.

In projects that involve multiple organizations, it\'s sometimes useful
to have a designated Corncob, whose role is to defend an existing
architecture from inappropriate changes. When there are many conflicting
technical viewpoints, a dominant personality is often required to
enforce the reference architecture.

### Refactored Solution

Solutions to the Corncob AntiPattern are applied at several levels of
authority, including strategic, operational, and tactical. In all cases,
the key action lever is management support for the destructive
behaviors. By eliminating management support at the aforementioned
levels, the Corncob loses support, and the best interests of the
software development team can dominate.

#### Tactical Solutions

Tactical solutions are actions employed on the fly, such as in a
meeting. They include the following:

-   *Transfer the responsibility.* Give the naysayer full responsibility
    for solving the problems they identify within an agreed-on time
    period. In other words, turn the responsibility for planning and
    resolution over to the person who raises the concerns.
-   *Isolate the issue.* Often, the Corncob\'s is an isolated opinion.
    Appealing to the group\'s interests is an effective way to defend
    against an individual\'s behavior or isolated concerns. If the
    Corncob is confrontational, remember to never take anything
    personally; doing so is always a mistake. Facilitate the group to
    discuss and frame the key objections, then try to gain consensus to
    overrule the objector. A straw poll is an effective technique for
    revealing group feeling.
-   *Question the question.* When the Corncob uses ambiguous or
    \"loaded\" words or phrases, ask him or her to clarify their
    meaning. When he or she uses hearsay evidence to make an assertion,
    ask him or her to substantiate the claims and to identify his or her
    personal position.

#### Operational Solutions

Operational actions are taken offline, within a limited organizational
scope. These include:

-   *Corrective interview.* Management meets individually with the
    person causing the problems, and explains the impact of his or her
    behavior. The purpose of the corrective interview is to raise
    awareness and reach agreement on how to change the behavior.
-   *Friendly outplacement.* Recommend a Corncob to employment
    headhunters to help him or her to exit gracefully a difficult
    situation in an organization.

#### Strategic Solutions

Strategic actions are long term and have a wider enterprise scope, such
as:

-   *Corncob support group.* If there are several Corncobs in an
    organization, management can transfer them into the same group. In
    this way, they have to contend with each other\'s personalities and
    behaviors. Often, each will approach management and ask why he or
    she has to work with such difficult people, giving the manager the
    opening to explain that the person is him- or herself described as
    difficult by others. This can result in self-awareness, and perhaps,
    improvement.
-   *Empty department.* Managers who are themselves difficult can be
    transferred to departments in which they are the only employee.
    These managers usually \"get the message\" and retire or pursue
    careers in other companies.
-   *Reduction in force.* Sometimes there is no other recourse than to
    eliminate difficult people from the project team or environment.

### Variations

Variations on the preceding solutions include:

-   *Sidelining.* Sidelining entails reassigning the Corncob to minimal
    duties. That said, we have found sidelining to be an ineffective
    practice, as it gives the Corncob more time to think and lobby his
    or her (often hidden) agenda.

-   *Third-World Information System Troubles (TWIT).* This term was
    introduced by Randall Oakes, MD, to refer to naysayers who resist IT
    change, even though the majority of people are experiencing negative
    consequences under current conditions.

    The TWIT benefits in some way from the status quo. As Dr. Oakes
    points out, helping the person manage his or her stress levels can
    lead to trust, friendship, and more open-mindedness.

-   *Corporate Shark.* A Corporate Shark is an experienced manager whose
    career consists of managing relationships rather than his or her
    technical expertise, which may, as a result, be long neglected.
    Sharks survive by who they know not what they know. The Corporate
    Shark knows how to \"work the system,\" and can easily create
    difficult political situations for those focused on technical
    issues.

    In the working world, everybody needs a friend. The best friend is
    the influential person in the company who defends you to the hilt
    when confronted by attacks from Corporate Sharks. The best way to
    manage a relationship with Corporate Sharks is to avoid them
    altogether, because the only likely outcomes are negative.

-   *Bonus Monster.* Someone stands to reap a short-term gain (such as
    an executive bonus) by cutting corners in the software development
    process. Bonus monsters are particularly destructive by encouraging
    internal competition between different departments within an
    enterprise. The problem is remedied by restructuring or eliminating
    the bonus system. A Bonus Monster is usually also a Corporate Shark,
    but a shark with strong motivation to push for bonus-generating
    outcomes.

-   *Firebrand.* A Firebrand is a person who deliberately creates a
    political emergency.

    For example, the Firebrand might be responsible for the late
    delivery of a critical piece of software by generating various
    misdirections and obstructions. His or her purpose is to create an
    emergency so that later he or she can be recognized as a hero for
    saving the organization. In order to achieve success, the firebrand
    extinguishes the fire; that is, he or she removes all the
    obstructions and readjusts the focus of the developers, as needed,
    to allow them to succeed.

-   *Egomaniac.* An Egomaniac is obsessed with his or her image as a key
    influencer or dominant figure. Egomaniacs are also called Prima
    Donnas. A remedy for senior managers who are Egomaniacs is to
    transfer them to an empty department. In meetings, Egomaniacs can be
    managed by publicly recognizing their expertise and importance.
    However, this sometimes backfires by encouraging their narcissist
    tendencies.

-   *Loose Cannon.* Certain people are consistently difficult to deal
    with due to their extrovert behavior. Their actions can have
    destructive effects on the project\'s image and morale; for example,
    indiscrete disclosures of information and insensitivity to important
    organizational relationships. Loose Cannons are easy to detect;
    during group situations, they quickly make their presence known. The
    most effective way to deal with Loose Cannons is to alert
    management, who should conduct a corrective interview.

-   *Technology Bigot.* A Technology Bigot is a Loose Cannon who
    promulgates marketing hype and refuses to consider other viewpoints;
    for example, people who insist that all information technology will
    become Microsoft-based, or that CORBA is the only true way to
    implement distributed objects.

-   *Territorial Corncob.* Individuals who attempt to protect
    organizational or technical turf often exhibit defensive behaviors.
    They need to defend their territory as a way of quieting underlying
    insecurities about their competence.

    Territorial Corncobs often can be placated with flattery and
    sensitivity to their weaknesses. Avoid appealing to their greed;
    Territorial Corncobs are particularly difficult to discourage once
    they sense the potential for new opportunities or power within the
    scope of their territory.

-   *Corncobs out of the Woodwork.* When a particularly difficult or
    stressful situation arises such as serious project problems or
    impending layoffs, some Corncobs amplify their behavior. In the case
    of layoffs, if you are a competent person who can obtain another
    job, consider volunteering for layoff so that others can retain
    their jobs and salaries that they may desperately need.

-   *Saboteur.* A Saboteur is someone about to exit the group who begins
    to manipulate the work environment in favor of their next
    assignment. For example, Saboteurs often try to make colleagues
    leave the project through active recruiting, rumors, and negative
    behaviors.

    This is a particularly difficult situation to detect and remedy
    because the Saboteur often conceals his or her intention to depart.
    One large computer manufacturer gave frequent after-hours
    parties---complete with large quantities of liquor---at which it
    encouraged its employees to discuss outside career plans. The
    Saboteur usually has one or more confidants who know of their plans.
    Once a Saboteur is discovered, he or she should be precluded from
    impacting the work environment.

-   *Careerist.* This is a variation of the Saboteur, a person who
    influences a technical choice that widens his or her personal
    expertise and job marketability. For example, a technical architect
    may choose to use an object database for object persistence, even
    though an RDBMS with an object API is a more appropriate technical
    solution.

-   *Anachronist.* This is a Corncob who resists innovation simply
    because he or she doesn\'t understand it. The Anachronist may be
    quite knowledgeable about legacy technologies, and resists new
    technologies arbitrarily. Education of the anachronist is often an
    effective solution.

### Examples

One of the Corporate Sharks that we encountered years ago was recently
transferred to a one-person department and then laid off because the
consequences of his personality traits outweighed his benefits to the
corporation. In our experience, Corncobs eventually self-destruct and
leave the organization. The downside to this is that they sometimes come
back.

A friend of ours underwent a dramatic personality change (for the
better) when he withdrew from participation in a corporate bonus system.
While under the bonus system, our friend engaged in a number of
confrontational interventions in various software processes due to his
desire for short-term outcomes (executive bonuses).

Territorial Corncobs can be the most abrasive variation. In particular,
if a person or group of people believe they \"own\" a particular
buzzword, such as \"architecture,\" they may attempt to vigorously
suppress anyone who uses it. E-mail is a particularly effective weapon
of the Territorial Corncob because it produces tangible evidence.

E-mail is also an easily manipulated medium for engaging in emotional
confrontations and flaming.

### Related Solutions

The technology bigot variation of this AntiPattern is also a form of the
Golden Hammer AntiPattern. See the Golden Hammer AntiPattern for a
related solution.

### Applicability To Other Viewpoints And Scales

The impact of Corncobs on architecture and development is usually to
slow down progress. Confrontational issues raised by Corncobs tend to
decrease the sophistication of the discussion and to instead focus on
specific forces.

In some sense, Corncob behaviors reverse the intended benefits of design
patterns. Instead of making the software process more sophisticated and
efficient, Corncobs make it less sophisticated and less efficient.

Instead of making the process more balanced, by taking into
consideration all of the significant forces, the Corncob tends to bias
the discussion and decision making toward selected forces, which may not
be the most significant.
