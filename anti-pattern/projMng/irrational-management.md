# Irrational Management {#irrational-management .title}




-   **Antipattern Name:** Irrational Management
-   **Also Known As:** Pathological Supervisor, Short-Term Thinking,
    Managing by Reaction, Decision Phobia, Managers Playing with
    Technical Toys
-   **Most Frequent Scale:** Enterprise
-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Rational Decision Making
-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Role and Process
-   **Root Causes:** Responsibility (the universal cause)
-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Resources
-   **Anecdotal Evidence:** \"Who\'s running this project?\" \"I wish
    he\'d make up his bloody mind!\" \"What do we do now?\" \"We better
    clear this with management before we get started.\" \"Don\'t bother
    asking; they\'ll just say no.\"

### Background

Irrational Management covers a range of commonly occurring software
project problems that can be traced back to the personalities of the
person(s) running the project.

For example, the manager may have obsessive interests in some aspect of
the technology or personality limitations that cause them to become
ineffective or irrational managers. Irrational management can be viewed
as a skewed set of priorities where the manager\'s personal priorities,
no matter how nonsensible, guide the software project in irrational
directions.

### General Form

The manager (or management team) of one or more development projects
cannot make decisions. This may be a personality defect or the result of
an obsession with details.

The details may be personal interests or behaviors of the manager, such
as technical \"toys\" or micromanagement. When faced with a crisis, the
manager\'s decisions are knee-jerk reactions rather than carefully
thought-out strategies or tactical actions. These reactions often cause
further problems. The cycle of indecision and reaction can escalate in
frequency and severity of consequences.

The Irrational Management AntiPattern is significantly compounded by a
manager\'s inability to direct development staff. This is also called a
lack of good people-management skills, characterized by the inability
to:

-   Recognize staff capabilities, both strengths and weaknesses.
-   Provide clear objectives that are appropriate to staff skills.
-   Communicate effectively with staff.

### Symptoms And Consequences

The primary symptom of the Irrational Management AntiPattern is *project
thrashing,* an ongoing debate on a critical topic. A decision must be
made to allow development staff to progress. Thrashing has several
consequences.

-   Increased staff frustration.
-   Incremental delays to delivery.
-   Exploitation by Corncobs.

### Typical Causes

The manager lacks the ability to manage:

-   Development staff.
-   Other managers.
-   Development processes.

He or she also has no clear vision and strategy, and therefore:

-   Cannot make decisions.
-   Fear of Success
-   Is ignorant of the true state of project activities and
    deliverables.

### Known Exceptions

There should never be any exceptions to the Irrational Management
AntiPattern. However, a \"golden child\" who possesses guru-level skills
that are completely unique in some manner and provides a major technical
advantage should be tolerated, while a better and longer-term solution
is planned.

### Refactored Solution

Follow these guidelines to resolve the Irrational Management
AntiPattern:

1.  *Admit you have a problem and get help.* When managers suffer from
    one or more of the typical causes, they must first recognize that
    they have a problem.

    Assuming that they are unaware of their situation, the first step is
    to identify key indicators, the most common of which is that of
    \"finding out the hard way.\"

    For example, rather than technical staff addressing a growing
    problem and asking for help in dealing with it, the irrational
    manager finds out only after a problem has reached crisis stage; no
    one is willing to discuss problems, because doing so never helps.
    Managers must surround themselves with talented staff (or
    consultants) who share the complex job of managing and are willing
    to listen to them.

2.  *Understand the development staff.* Managers need to understand both
    the technical skills and the personality traits of their staff
    members. Awareness of technical skills helps a manager delegate
    work; awareness of personalities helps a manager designate working
    relationships.

3.  *Provide clear, short-term goals.* Easily achievable objectives
    should be specified for the project. Long-term objectives are
    necessary, but do not as successfully motivate staff on a daily
    basis. A manager must ensure that short-term, highly specific
    objectives are set and that staff understands how they can be
    achieved.

4.  *Share a focus.* Project staff must share the purpose of their
    project to ensure they are all working toward the same goals. The
    manager must initiate and grow the focus.

5.  *Look for process improvement.* Recognizing that every project is
    slightly different from the previous one, a manager must monitor the
    development processes and improve them where and when necessary.
    Although these are often small tweaks to make a specific process
    more pragmatic, they can significantly improve productivity.

6.  *Facilitate communication.* Whenever a \"hot\" topic fuels debate,
    deciding on the way to move forward is best achieved in a
    facilitated session. To do so:

7.  -   Identify the key players.
    -   Collect evidence on the debate.
    -   Get clear agreement on the problem(s).
    -   Make sure everyone\'s voice is heard.
    -   Confirm that the solution options are understood by all.
    -   Agree to the preferred option.
    -   Involve the concerned staff in implementing the solution where
        possible.

8.  *Manage communication mechanisms.* E-mail and newsgroups in general
    are useful communication mechanisms, but both can set people on a
    winding path of destruction. E-mails can quickly get out of hand,
    and newsgroups can generate arrogant and aggressive debates.

    The solution is to track e-mails and newsgroup postings daily and
    identify any miscommunications. Talk directly to the involved
    parties and tell them to stop the electronic debate. If it\'s
    important to find a solution, then a facilitated meeting is usually
    faster and far more effective.

9.  *Manage by exception.* Extremes are always dangerous, and
    overmanagement is no exception. Daily meetings and weekly reviews
    that require a manager\'s involvement in all threads of a project
    are examples of over- or micromanagement. Instead, manage by
    exception; watch, but don\'t interfere. Allow problems some time to
    be resolved by others. Step in only when necessary.

10. *Apply effective decision-making techniques.* Two rational
    management techniques from Kepner-Tregoe are particularly effective
    in software decision making. The first is called *situation
    analysis* This technique assists in the organization and management
    of unstructured and chaotic environments. It can be used on an
    individual or group basis.

    The second is called *decision analysis* This technique is essential
    for making decisions objectively. Subjective biases in
    decision-making processes can have devastating consequences in
    software projects. We have often seen these kind of biases result in
    software disasters.

    Biases can be generated by friendships, the timing of the sales
    call, unnecessary platform constraints, and invisible infrastructure
    constraints.

These two techniques are explained in some depth in the following
subsections.

#### Situation Analysis

The purpose of situation analysis is to identify the highest-priority
concerns in a complex situation. A tailored version of this technique
contains the following steps:

1.  *List all of the concerns.* These may include known issues, action
    items, commitments, technology gaps, and other items. In other
    words, the list may contain virtually anything that affects the
    project at hand.

2.  *Rate the concerns with respect to three criteria: seriousness,
    urgency, and growth potential.* Use three levels: high, medium, and
    low.

    For example, if the concern is critical to project success, it is
    highly serious. If the concern must be resolved immediately for the
    resolution to be effective, it is rated highly urgent. If the
    seriousness is expected to increase dramatically in time, it is
    rated as having high growth potential.

3.  *Tabulate scores for each item based upon the ratings.* Assign
    numbers to the rating levels: high = 2, medium = 1, and low = 0. For
    example, a rating of high/medium/low would score 3 points (2 + 1 +
    0).

4.  *Prioritize the items in terms of the scores.* For all of the
    concerns that score 6, choose the most important, second important,
    and so forth. Continue the priority assignment with the items
    scoring 5 and lower, until the entire list of concerns is assigned a
    priority number.

5.  *Assign the items that can be resolved to the appropriate staff.*
    Some items on the list will be controlled by external forces, and it
    would be unreasonable to expend energy resolving them until the
    situation changes. Other items must be resolved before others due to
    dependencies. For the properly qualified staff, the resolution of
    most items will be straightforward: Program a necessary object,
    create an analysis model, reduce risk through testing, and so forth.
    The manager must make the best match of staff resources to the
    concerns that must be resolved.

6.  *Work on the top-priority items on the list.* The situation analysis
    technique works on the principle of addressing first things first
    and second things never. Using situation analysis, the manager can
    effectively address the most important issues from among the
    confusing list of concerns confronting software projects.

#### Decision Analysis

A tailored process for decision analysis contains these steps:

1.  *Define the scope of the decision to be addressed.* In other words,
    the process must begin with a written question to resolve.
2.  *Identify alternative solutions for resolving the decision.* These
    can include specific concrete alternatives, such as specific
    software products or categories of solutions that can be evaluated.
3.  *Define the decision criteria.* Situation analysis can be used to
    create this list.
4.  *Divide the criteria between the essentials and desirables.* The
    essential criteria are characteristics that must be part of the
    solution in order for it to be acceptable. If any essential criteria
    are missing from an alternative, the alternative is disqualified.
    For this reason, the essential criteria should be a carefully
    chosen, short list. All other criteria are called desirables, and
    they must be prioritized. Use the priority assignment process from
    situation analysis for this purpose, then assign the desirable
    alternatives a weight. For example, if there are seven criteria, the
    most important has a weight of 7; the next most important has a
    weight of 6, and so forth.
5.  Determine whether the alternatives satisfy all the essential
    criteria. If not, eliminate the unsatisfactory alternatives.
6.  *Perform any fact finding.* Research to assess the satisfaction of
    the criteria by each of the alternatives.
7.  *Set up a table that displays the alternatives in columns and the
    criteria in rows.* In the table, rank the alternatives for desirable
    criteria. For example, if there are five alternatives, the best
    alternative gets a rank of 5; next best gets a rank of 4, and so
    forth.
8.  *Multiply the weights by the ranks to calculate a score for each
    position in the matrix.* Add up the scores in each column to
    calculate the score for each alternative. The highest scoring
    alternative is the rational (or best) choice.
9.  *Be aware that the rational choice may not be the choice that
    managers or customers will accept.* An important bias or criteria
    that was not properly reflected in the decision analysis may cause
    this, in which case, it is important to evaluate the decision
    criteria. Experiment with the weights on the desirable criteria, and
    add new criteria until the decision analysis selects the acceptable
    alternative. Confirm that the resulting criteria and weights match
    the subjective decision criteria that drive this solution. Perhaps
    the decision-making authorities will change their criteria to more
    realistic assumptions when confronted with the actual influence that
    their biases have on the decision.

### Variations

Consultants can be an invaluable resource. They can bring missing
knowledge and skills to an organization, and can give advice that is
independent of internal politics and detailitis; that is, they can be
objective in a charged situation. Consultants can play three key roles
in a software project. These categories are based on Block\'s model for
general consulting practice :

1.  Pair of Hands.
2.  Technical Expert.
3.  Management Peer.

Filling the Pair-of-Hands role, the consultant becomes another software
developer, similar to that of an ordinary employee. As a
Technical-Expert, the consultant resolves problems in a specific domain.

As a Management-Peer, the consultant is an advisor to management,
providing a mentoring knowledge transfer from his or her related
experience. Although it\'s professionally rewarding for the consultant
to be in the latter two roles, we have seen outstanding results from the
Pair-of-Hands role, particularly in rapid prototyping situations with
new technologies.

### Examples

A manager we worked with came into a project at the halfway point. He
did not have an understanding of the staff\'s skills, nor a good
background on the project to date.

When problems occurred, he reallocated staff. This created more serious
problems. Staff members were moved onto projects to which they had no
previous exposure. This resulted in diminished effectiveness. The
situation was partially resolved when the manager left the company.

The new manager was a very strong \"people-person\" who made sure that
employees\' skills matched the necessary activities. Unfortunately, the
delays already experienced could not be made up for.

In another situation, a project architect (a Corncob) voiced his
opinions on C ++ coding standards via e-mail to all project staff. The
project had several guru-level C ++ developers who took exception to
some of the architect\'s statements.

This resulted in a two-month e-mail and newsgroup \"war.\" The eventual
solution was that the project manager appointed a \"tiger team\" to
resolve the issue. This was a facilitated solution based upon the
run-ahead principle. Unfortunately, no precautions were taken to
eliminate similar destructive communications on a variety of other
topics. The instance was dealt with rather than the overriding problem.

In a third example, a system\'s integrator project had an irrational
management team. The individual managers were owners of their part of
the process. This created stovepipe processes with neither coherence nor
contiguity. This resulted in various ownership wars.

One war was based on the entrance criteria to move from one phase of the
development to the next. This caused a month of thrashing and
disagreement, which then diffused focus on emerging development
problems. Corporate management had to step in. And because the
resolution was enforced from above, it was not sustainable.

</figure>

The final solution, after several wars between the owners, was the
appointment of a process facilitator whose job was to ensure that:

-   A coherent and contiguous process was produced.
-   The entrance criteria were agreed on for each phase of the
    development, which supported iterative delivery.
-   Process improvements were implemented across the relevant processes.
