# Stovepipe System {#stovepipe-system .title}




-   **AntiPattern Name:** Stovepipe System
-   **Also Known As:** Legacy System, Uncle Sam Special, Ad Hoc
    Integration
-   **Most Frequent Scale:** System
-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Architecture Framework
-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Software
-   **Root Causes:** Haste, Avarice, Ignorance, Sloth
-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Complexity, Change
-   **Anecdotal Evidence:** \"The software project is way over-budget;
    it has slipped its schedule repeatedly; my users still don\'t get
    the expected features; and I can\'t modify the system. Every
    component is a stovepipe.\"

### Background

Stovepipe System is a widely used derogatory name for legacy software
with undesirable qualities. In this AntiPattern, we attribute the cause
of these negative qualities to the internal structure of the system.

An improved system structure enables the evolution of the legacy system
to meet new business needs and incorporate new technologies seamlessly.
By applying the recommended solution, the system can gain new
capabilities for adaptability that are uncharacteristic of Stovepipe
Systems.

### General Form

The Stovepipe System AntiPattern is the single-system analogy of
Stovepipe Enterprise, which involves a lack of coordination and planning
across a set of systems. The Stovepipe System AntiPattern addresses how
the subsystems are coordinated within a single system.

The key problem in this AntiPattern is the lack of common subsystem
abstractions, whereas in a Stovepipe Enterprise, the key problem is the
absence of common multisystem conventions.

Subsystems are integrated in an ad hoc manner using multiple integration
strategies and mechanisms. All subsystems are integrated point to point,
thus the integration approach for each pair of subsystems is not easily
leveraged toward that of other subsystems.

Furthermore, the system implementation is brittle because there are many
implicit dependencies upon system configuration, installation details,
and system state. The system is difficult to extend, and extensions add
additional point-to-point integration links.

As each new capability and alteration is integrated, system complexity
increases, throughout the life cycle of the stovepipe system;
subsequently, system extension and maintenance become increasingly
intractable.

### Symptoms And Consequences

-   Large semantic gap between architecture documentation and
    implemented software; documentation does not correspond to system
    implementation.
-   Architects are unfamiliar with key aspects of integration solution.
-   Project is over-budget and has slipped its schedule for no obvious
    reason.
-   Requirements changes are costly to implement, and system maintenance
    generates surprising costs.
-   System may comply with most paper requirements but does not meet
    user expectations.
-   Users must invent workarounds to cope with limitations of the
    system.
-   Complex system and client installation procedures are followed that
    defy attempts to automate.
-   Interoperability with other systems is not possible, and there is an
    inability to support integrated system management and intersystem
    security capabilities.
-   Changes to the systems become increasingly difficult.
-   System modifications become increasingly likely to introduce new
    serious bugs.

### Typical Causes

-   Multiple infrastructure mechanisms used to integrate subsystems;
    absence of a common mechanism makes the architecture difficult to
    describe and modify.
-   Lack of abstraction; all interfaces are unique to each subsystem.
-   Insufficient use of metadata; metadata is not available to support
    system extensions and reconfigurations without software changes.
-   Tight coupling between implemented classes requires excessive client
    code that is service-specific.
-   Lack of architectural vision.

### Known Exceptions

Research and development software production often institute the
Stovepipe System AntiPattern to achieve a rapid solution.

This is perfectly acceptable for prototypes and mockups; and sometimes,
insufficient knowledge about a domain may require a Stovepipe System to
be initially developed to gain domain information either for building a
more robust system or for evolving the initial system into an improved
version Or, the choice to use a vendor\'s product and not reinvent the
wheel can lead to both the Stovepipe System AntiPattern and the Vendor
Lock-In AntiPattern.

### Refactored Solution

The refactored solution to the Stovepipe System AntiPattern is a
component architecture that provides for flexible substitution of
software modules. Subsystems are modeled abstractly so that there are
many fewer exposed interfaces than there are subsystem implementations.

The substitution can be both static (compile-time component replacement)
and dynamic (run-time dynamic binding). The key to defining the
component interfaces is to discover the appropriate abstractions. The
subsystem abstractions model the interoperability needs of the system
without exposing unnecessary differences between subsystems and
implementation-specific details.

</figure>

In order to define a component architecture, you should choose a base
level of functionality that the majority of applications will support.
In general, that level should be low and focus upon a single aspect of
interoperability, such as data interchange or conversion.

Then define a set of system interfaces that support this base level of
functionality; we recommend using ISO IDL. Most services have an
additional interface to express finer-grained functional needs so the
component interface should be small.

Having a base level of component services available to all clients in
the domain encourages the development of thin clients that work well
with existing and future services, without modification.

By thin clients, we mean clients that do not require detailed knowledge
of the services and architecture of the system; a framework may support
and simplify their access to complex services. Having several
plug-compatible implementations available increases the robustness of
clients, as they potentially have many options in fulfilling their
service request.

Applications will have clients that are written to more specialized
(vertical) interfaces. Vertical clients should remain unaffected by the
addition of the new component interfaces.

Clients that require only the base level of functionality can be written
to the horizontal interfaces, which should be more stable and easily
supported by new or other existing applications. The horizontal
interface should hide, via abstraction, all the lower-level details of a
component and provide only the base-level functionality. The client
should be written to handle whatever data types are indicated by the
interface in order to support any future interchange of the horizontal
component implementations.

For example, if an \"any\" is returned, the client should be capable of
handling all types that the \"any\" may contain. Admittedly, for CORBA
implementations that don\'t support the transfer of new user-defined
types at run time, type management may have to occur at the horizontal
level; specifically, it may be necessary to convert vertical types into
horizontal types that are known at compile time.

Incorporation of metadata into the component architecture is key to
service discovery and service discrimination. A fundamental level of
metadata support is through naming and trading services Naming services
enable the discovery of known objects; a trading service lists the
available services and their properties for discovery by clients.

Interoperable naming services are extended to incorporate some trading
capabilities. More extensive use of metadata is usually required for
enhanced decoupling of clients from services. For example, schema
metadata for database services helps clients to adapt alternative schema
and schema changes

### Example

figure below is a representation of a typical stovepipe system. There
are three client subsystems and six service subsystems. Each subsystem
has a unique software interface, and each subsystem instance is modeled
as a class in the class diagram.

When the system is constructed, unique interface software for each
client corresponds to each of the integrated subsystems. If additional
subsystems are added or substituted, the clients must be modified with
additional code that integrates new unique interfaces.

class="2x" loading="lazy" />
</figure>

The refactored solution to this example considers the common
abstractions between the subsystems. Since there are two services of
each type, it is possible for each model to have one or more service
interface in common. Then each particular device or service can be
wrapped to support the common interface abstraction.

If additional devices are added to the system from these abstract
subsystem categories, they can be integrated transparently to the
existing system software. The addition of a trader service adds the
ability to discover and discriminate between the abstracted services.

### Related Solutions

The Stovepipe Enterprise AntiPattern describes how stovepipe practices
are promulgated on an enterprise scale. Note that Stovepipe Enterprise
addresses a multisystem problem, which involves a larger scale of
architecture than a single system.

### Applicability To Other Viewpoints And Scales

The management consequences of Stovepipe Systems are: increased risk,
bigger budget, and longer time to market. And because complexity
increases throughout the life cycle of the system, the management
problems magnify as development progresses.

Eventually, the risks of system modification outweigh the potential
benefits, and the Stovepipe System ceases to adapt to new business
needs; the organization\'s business processes are frozen by the
Stovepipe System. Since the architecture information is buried in the
implementation, employee turnover in the software maintenance staff can
lead to a total loss of capability to modify or maintain the system.

For developers, Stovepipe Systems mean they must spend more time on
system discovery and testing. In early development, developers have a
great deal of freedom to choose implementation strategies with minimal
architectural guidance, but as the complexity of the stovepipe
interfaces supercedes the documentation, the system becomes increasingly
complex and brittle.

Development in a stovepipe environment resembles walking through a mine
field. Every decision involves guesswork, uncertainty, and experiments.
Developer decisions have high-risk consequences for the business, and
often lead to repeated crises.
