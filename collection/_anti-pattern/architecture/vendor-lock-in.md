# Vendor Lock-In {#vendor-lock-in .title}




-   **AntiPattern Name:** Vendor Lock-In

-   **Also Known As:** Product-Dependent Architecture, Bondage and
    Submission, Connector Conspiracy

-   **Most Frequent Scale:** System

-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Isolation Layer

-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Software

-   **Root Causes:** Sloth, Apathy, Pride/Ignorance (Gullibility)

-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Technology Transfer, Management
    of Change

-   **Anecdotal Evidence:**

    We have often encountered software projects that claim their
    architecture is based upon a particular vendor or product line.

    Other anecdotal evidence occurs around the time of product upgrades
    and new application installations:

    \"When I try to read the new data files into the old version of the
    application, it crashes my system.\" \"Once you read data into the
    new application, you can never get it out again.\" \"The old
    software acts like it has a virus, but it\'s probably just the new
    application data.\" \"Our architecture is.. What\'s the name of our
    database again?\"

### Background

A worst-case scenario of this AntiPattern would occur if your data and
software licenses were completely allocated to online services, and one
day, a modal dialog box popped up.

Interactive word processing became more popular than formatting language
technologies (like SGML) because it allows the user to see the final
format on the computer screen and print an exact copy of the on-screen
appearance. This capability is called \"What you see is what you get\"
(WYSIWIG).

A pervasive variation of Vendor Lock-In is the phenomenon called \"What
you see is sort-of like what you get\" (WYSISLWYG, pronounced \"weasel
wig\"). Recently, given the desktop dominance of Microsoft, product
misfeatures cause the printed versions of documents to vary
significantly from their on-screen appearance. For example, symbols in
drawings can change or disappear, and embedded objects are often printed
as command strings (like \"{EMBEDDED POWERPOINT FIGURE}\").

Documents from different versions of the same Microsoft product can
cause support problems on corporate networks and system crashes. Many
companies discourage or outlaw co-mingling of product versions. It is
difficult to avoid this form of vendor lock-in and its product
misfeatures because of organizational dependence on Microsoft\'s
products for document interchange.

### General Form

A software project adopts a product technology and becomes completely
dependent upon the vendor\'s implementation. When upgrades are done,
software changes and interoperability problems occur, and continuous
maintenance is required to keep the system running.

In addition, expected new product features are often delayed, causing
schedule slips and an inability to complete desired application software
features.

### Symptoms And Consequences

-   Commercial product upgrades drive the application software
    maintenance cycle.
-   Promised product features are delayed or never delivered,
    subsequently, causing failure to deliver application updates.
-   The product varies significantly from the advertised open systems
    standard.
-   If a product upgrade is missed entirely, a product repurchase and
    reintegration is often necessary.

### Typical Causes

-   The product varies from published open system standards because
    there is no effective conformance process for the standard.
-   The product is selected based entirely upon marketing and sales
    information, and not upon more detailed technical inspection.
-   There is no technical approach for isolating application software
    from direct dependency upon the product.
-   Application programming requires in-depth product knowledge.
-   The complexity and generality of the product technology greatly
    exceeds that of the application needs; direct dependence upon the
    product results in failure to manage the complexity of the
    application system architecture.

### Known Exceptions

The Vendor Lock-In AntiPattern is acceptable when a single vendor\'s
code makes up the majority of code needed in an application.

### Refactored Solution

The refactioned solution to the Vendor Lock-In AntiPattern is called
*isolation layer.* An isolation layer separates software packages and
technology. It can be used to provide software portability from
underlying middleware and platform-specific interfaces. This solution is
applicable when one or more of the following conditions apply:

-   *Isolation of application software from lower-level infrastructure.*
    This infrastructure may include middleware, operating systems,
    security mechanisms, or other low-level mechanisms.
-   *Changes to the underlying infrastructure are anticipated within the
    life cycle of the affected software;* for example, new product
    releases or planned migration to new infrastructure.
-   *A more convenient programming interface is useful or necessary.*
    The level of abstraction provided by the infrastructure is either
    too primitive or too flexible for the intended applications and
    systems.
-   *There a need for consistent handling of the infrastructure across
    many systems.* Some heavyweight conventions for default handling of
    infrastructure interfaces must be instituted.
-   Multiple infrastructures must be supported, either during the life
    cycle or concurrently.

class="2x" />
</figure>

The solution entails creating a layer of software that abstracts the
underlying infrastructure or product-dependent software interfaces. This
layer provides an application interface that completely isolates the
application software from the underlying interfaces.

The application interface should implement a convenient
language-specific interface to desired capabilities. The layering
software should ensure default handling of some infrastructure calls and
parameters, but expose other details when appropriate.

This isolation layer is used across multiple system development projects
to assure interoperability, consistency, and isolation. To implement it,
migrate the isolation to new infrastructures as necessary; also, update
the isolation layer when the infrastructure is updated. In all cases,
maintain the same application software interface, regardless of
infrastructure changes.

It is also necessary to install gateways between multiple
infrastructures that must be supported concurrently, and to install
forward and reverse gateways during infrastructure migration

The benefits of this solution are:

-   Mitigation of the risks and costs of infrastructure migration.
-   Precluding obsolescence caused by to infrastructure changes.
-   Reduction of the risk and cost of software upgrades required by
    infrastructure changes.
-   Assurance of a less labor-intensive and more inexpensive programming
    interface to most application programmers.
-   Support for the concurrent use of multiple infrastructures,
    transparently.
-   Enforcement of coordinated default handling of flexible interfaces
    and parameters.
-   Separation of infrastructure knowledge from application knowledge,
    thereby enabling a small team of infrastructure developers to
    maintain the isolation layer, while the majority of programmers have
    a customized interface to the layering software.

Other consequences of this solution are that:

-   The isolation layer must be migrated and maintained, potentially on
    multiple platforms and infrastructures.
-   The developers who define the initial isolation layer interfaces
    must be coordinated.
-   Changes made to the application interfaces must be coordinated.

### Variations

This solution is often used at the global level in commercial products
and technologies. Typically, the isolation layer enables the vendor to
provide a convenient language-specific interface to a lower-level
technology. Some of this convenience comes in the form of default
handling of lower-level interfaces that are more flexible than necessary
for most applications.

For example, the HP Object-Oriented Distributed Computing Environment
(OO DCE) product comprises an isolation layer, and presents a C ++
interface to application developers. Underlying this interface is an
isolation layer of software that is built upon the C language DCE
environment.

Calls to the C ++ APIs can invoke several underlying DCE procedure
calls; in particular, just two calls are needed to initialize OO DCE
security service interfaces. The underlying isolation layer, in turn,
makes more than 50 calls to DCE APIs to achieve this initialization with
the legacy DCE security service.

The isolation layer solution is most applicable at the enterprise level.
However, individual systems have applied this solution to provide
middleware isolation; for example, the Paragon Electronic Light Table
(ELT) product uses an isolation layer above the Common Desktop
Environment (CDE) middleware infrastructure, called ToolTalk. By
isolating ToolTalk, Paragon can easily migrate its product to a CORBA
infrastructure and support both CORBA and ToolTalk infrastructures.

### Example

The following examples are three known uses of the isolation layer
solution:

1.  The ORBlite framework, based on HP ORB plus, isolates application
    software from multiple language mappings and network protocols Thus,
    it was able to support multiple language mappings for C ++ , given
    the evolution of the OMG mappings during the adoption and revision
    process

2.  Even though OpenDoc is no longer in the product strategy of its
    creator, some interesting technical approaches were used, including
    the isolation layer solution. The OpenDoc Parts Framework (OPF)
    institutes a higher-level C ++ programming interface to the OpenDoc
    compound document interface, defined in ISO IDL. OPF includes
    interfaces to operating system functions (including display
    graphics), as well as OpenDoc functions.

    In doing so, OPF enables source code portability interfaces for
    middleware, windowing, and operating systems. Compound document
    parts written using OPF can be ported via recompilation and linking
    to OS/2, MacOS, and Windows95. A testing capability called
    LiveObjects, from the Component Integration Labs, the consortium
    responsible for OpenDoc, assures component portability and
    interoperability.

3.  EOSDIS (Earth Observing System Data and Information System) is a
    large-scale information retrieval project funded by NASA. The EOSDIS
    middleware abstraction layer was used to isolate application
    software and evolving middleware. Initial prototypes used a
    beta-test CORBA product.

    These prototyping efforts proved unsuccessful, largely due to
    difficulties in using the beta-test product. Although program
    management acknowledged the need for future CORBA support, a
    proprietary object-oriented DCE extension was chosen for short-term
    implementations. Management also did not want to rely entirely on
    proprietary interfaces.

    The situation was resolved through the addition of a middleware
    abstraction layer that masked the choice of middleware from EOSDIS
    application software; it hid differences in object creation, object
    activation, and object invocation.

### Related Solutions

This pattern is related to the Object Wrapper pattern , which provides
isolation to and from a single application to a single object
infrastructure. The isolation layer pattern provides insulation of
multiple applications from multiple infrastructures. This pattern is
also related to the Profile pattern , where an isolation layer can be
viewed as a particular enterprise profile for the use of middleware.

The isolation layer can be thought of as one the levels in a layered
architecture In contrast to most layers, this is a very thin layer that
does not contain application objects. Typically, an isolation layer
serves only as a proxy for integrating clients and services with one or
more infrastructures. The Proxy pattern is described in Buschmann
(1996).

### Applicability To Other Viewpoints And Scales

The impact of Vendor Lock-In on management is a loss of control of the
technology, IT functionality, and O&M budgets to the dictates of vendor
product releases. Vendor Lock-In also impacts risk management. The
AntiPattern is often accepted with the understanding that future
features will be implemented. Unfortunately, these feature often deliver
later than expected or needed, if ever.

Vendor Lock-In affects developers by requiring they have in-depth
product knowledge. But this knowledge is transient; it will be made
obsolete by the next product release. Thus, developers are expected to
be on a continuous learning-curve treadmill about product features,
product bugs, and product futures.
