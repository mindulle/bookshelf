# Project Mismanagement {#project-mismanagement .title}




-   **Antipattern Name:** Project Mismanagement
-   **Also Known As:** Humpty Dumpty
-   **Most Frequent Scale:** Enterprise
-   **Refactored Solution Name:** Risk Management
-   **Refactored Solution Type:** Process and Role
-   **Root Causes:** Responsibility (the universal cause)
-   **Unbalanced Forces:** Management of Risk (the universal force)
-   **Anecdotal Evidence:** \"What went wrong? Everything was fine and
    then suddenly\... KABOOM!\"

### Background

This AntiPattern concerns the monitoring and controlling of software
projects. The timeframe for this occurs after planning activities, and
during the actual analysis, design, construction, and testing of the
software system. Project mismanagement involves mistakes made in the day
to day running of a project, assuming planning errors (such as Death By
Planning) have not been made.

### General Form

Running a project is as complex an activity as creating the project
plan, and developing software is as complex as building skyscrapers,
involving as many steps and processes, including checks and balances.
Often, key activities are overlooked or minimized.

These include technical planning (architecture) and quality-control
activities (inspection and test). In particular, basic mistakes include:
inadequate architecture definition, insufficient code review (software
inspection), and inadequate test coverage.

Under the test umbrella, several phases are needed, but often minimized:
unit, integration, and system testing. Simple integration testing
comprises basic checking of unit-tested components for interoperability.
Full integration testing checks all known success paths and error
states.

Architecture establishes the detailed technology plan for the project,
including the criteria for inspection and testing. When an inadequate
architecture is defined, there is insufficient basis for checking the
design during the inspection and testing phases. When testing is
performed, the software modules may be integrated according the
architecture, but are not able to interoperate according to the
application\'s needs.

### Symptoms And Consequences

-   The design is difficult to implement due to lack of an architectural
    strategy.
-   Code reviews and inspections happen infrequently and add minimal
    value.
-   The test design requires extra effort and guesswork because the
    behavioral guidelines for the system are inadequately defined.
-   In the integration and system testing phases, there is much project
    \"thrashing\" due to a large number of defects that should have been
    eliminated in earlier phases such as architecture, design,
    inspection, and unit testing.
-   Defect reports escalate toward the end of the development and
    delivery/acceptance phases.

### Typical Causes

-   An inadequate architecture does not define the technical criteria
    for inspection, testing, integration, and interoperability.
-   Code reviews and software inspections do not evaluate design
    defects, which then must be addressed in more expensive phases such
    as acceptance testing.
-   Insufficient test suites check basic integration needs, but do not
    address full interoperability needs for the application.
-   All of the preceding factors indicate ineffective risk management,
    which can be traced to the professional practices of the architect,
    designers, and management.

### Known Exceptions

There should never be any exceptions to the Project Mismanagement
AntiPattern.

### Refactored Solution

Proper risk management is an effective means of resolving predictable
symptoms and consequences of the Project Mismanagement AntiPattern.
Risks are categorized in several useful ways: managerial, common project
failure points , and quality. It\'s necessary to understand these
categories in order to better qualify the risks.

#### Managerial

These risks are primarily caused and resolved by corporate management:

-   *Processes.* An end-to-end definition of product development.
-   *Roles.* The specific responsibilities for implementation of the
    processes.

#### Common Project Failure Points

These key project risks are based upon twenty-three risk drivers:

-   Cost overruns.
-   Premature termination of project.
-   Development of the wrong product.
-   Technical failure.

#### Quality

-   *Program and project management.* The effectiveness of the planning
    and control process.
-   *Product identification.* The accuracy of the problem definition.
-   *Architecture definition.* The specification of a design and coding
    strategy.
-   *Solution design.* The ability to deliver a consistent and optimized
    code specification that fully supports the solution.
-   *Solution implementation (coding).* The ability to produce an
    accurate code implementation of the design, which functions in the
    expected manner.
-   *Solution validation (testing).* The proof that the implemented
    solution fully meets the problem requirements.
-   *Product support.* The ongoing ability to maintain and enhance a
    released product.

#### Common Understanding

Often, a theme of risk management is the absence of a common
understanding, resulting in an inconsistent view of development, which
leads to the risk of the solution not meeting the scope of the problem
requirements. A company must understand its software developments across
all sites and all projects. Every project must share common knowledge
about its development.

Ideally, all (or most) development staff on a project will have a
reasonable, overall comprehension of the problem requirements and the
intended solution. Unfortunately, often this is not the case, leading to
one or more of these failings:

-   *Missed functionality.* One or more component services were never
    built because there was no shared view of how all of the components
    would interact on the delivery platform.
-   *Incorrect functionality.* Some component does not perform the full
    functionality required because its use was never shared by
    developers with users (other developers).
-   *Overfunctionality.* The requirements were never clearly understood
    and \"the devil in the details\" was never extricated. This leads to
    software development under \"good intentions,\" without any
    requirement or need ever being clearly established.
-   *Code modules will interface but not fully interoperate.* There was
    no definition of the threads of control across system and module
    boundaries.

The refactored solution entails activities at the architectural and
design stages of development. At the architecture level, the
dependencies between modules must be defined. This includes the
assignment of responsibilities that define the interdependence between
modules and the partitioning of the system\'s functionality. At the
design level, the threads of control (use cases) across modules must be
defined. This includes all of the successful use cases as well as
defined error states.

### Variations

A formal risk management activity is one way to document and plan for
risk mitigation. Formal risk management entails the identification and
documentation of project risks, usually in a tabular format, which
includes columns for risk severity, risk description, and risk
mitigation.

Risk management plans are often produced with the formal documentation
of projects, but are rarely translated into funded project activities.
It is important to prioritize the project risks and budget research in
risk-mitigation activities that represent critical points of failure.

Another variation, a run-ahead team, is often employed to investigate
the capabilities of new products and the compatibility of technologies.
The run-ahead team creates prototypes that resemble the target
architecture of the system, using the primary technologies or technical
backups.

The run-ahead team also identifies any technology shortcomings and
investigates workaround strategies. The team then educates the rest of
the project staff on the new technology, thereby shortening learning
curves. Finally, the run-ahead team must precede the main development
activity by one to three months. Otherwise, the main project may be
delayed waiting for the results of the run-ahead research.

### Example

A software development does not manage it\'s code delivery. The
development teams are left to their own devices as to how to get from
design to delivery. This means that they each have to deal with quality
and process issues via self-derived mechanisms and manage their own
activities. The risk becomes unacceptable code through lack of adherence
to:

-   Coding standards (including traceability to the design)
-   Code reviews
-   Test planning
-   Unit testing
-   API testing
-   Integration testing
-   Feature testing
-   Program documentation

The risk manifests itself as poorly documented code that has been
largely untested and does not integrate, nor fully meet the
requirements.

The appointment of a new project manager results in quality/process
improvements. The improvements are incremental and are actively owned by
the teams through a series of facilitated \"lookback\" sessions to
identify problems and issues, and then the creation of emissary groups
to address them via incremental process improvements.

Each emissary group consists of a facilitator from product support and a
development team owner (for each team) for that part of the process:

-   Design
-   Coding
-   Testing
-   Documentation

Each emissary group team member is responsible for:

-   Refining the specific process.
-   Educating their team.
-   Providing subjective assessment of the team\'s implementation of the
    specific process and the quality of it\'s deliverables.
-   Liaising with other emissaries to maintain a consistent standard of
    process implementation and problem resolution.

Within six months each process had been incrementally refined several
times and each team had implemented each process at least once. The
improvements were major reductions (over 50%) in:

-   Code defects
-   Documentation defects
-   Untested code

### Related Solutions

A variation of the Smoke and Mirrors mini-AntiPattern describes the
incorporation of technical backups into the project plan and activities.
This is an important complement to risk management, and mitigates key
strategic errors introduced by Project Mismanagement.

Brad Appleton presents an excellent design pattern language for
improving software development processes in his paper on process
improvement Implementing process improvement is a key element in
resolving project mismanagement.
