# Activity Diagrams {#activity-diagrams .title}




Activity diagrams, which are related to program flow plans (flowcharts),
are used to illustrate activities. In the external view, we use activity
diagrams for the description of those business processes that describe
the functionality of the business system.

Contrary to use case diagrams, in activity diagrams it is obvious
whether actors can perform business use cases together or independently
from one another.

Activity diagrams allow you to think functionally. Purists of the
object-oriented approach probably dislike this fact. We, on the other
hand, regard this fact as a great advantage, since users of
object-oriented methods, as well as users of functional thinking
patterns, find a common and familiar display format, which is a
significant aid for business-process modeling.

Because it is possible to explicitly describe parallel events, the
activity diagram is well suited for the illustration of business
processes, since business processes rarely occur in a linear manner and
often exhibit parallelisms.

Activity diagrams can be developed in various degrees of detail. They
can be refined step by step. In the external view, activity diagrams,
just like use case diagrams, exclusively represent business processes
and activities from the outside perspective. Refining diagrams does not
mean describing process details that are performed within the business
system, which often leads to an unnoticed shift to the internal view
(Figure 3.15):

### Activity

An activity diagram illustrates one individual activity. In our context,
an activity represents a business process (Figure 3.16). Fundamental
elements of the activity are actions and control elements (decision,
division, merge, initiation, end, etc.):

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_35.jpg" />
</figure>

Elements are connected by so-called "activity edges" and form the
"control flow", which can also be casually called 'flow'. The execution
of an activity can contain parallel flows. A border can surround the
activity, meaning the entire activity diagram.

### Action

An action is an individual step within an activity, for example, a
calculation step that is not deconstructed any further. That does not
necessarily mean that the action cannot be subdivided in the real world,
but in this diagram will not be refined any further:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_36.jpg" />
</figure>

The action can possess input and output information The output of one
action can be the input of a subsequent action within an activity.
Specific actions are calling other actions, receiving an event, and
sending signals.

### Calling an Activity (Action)

With this symbol an activity can be called from within another activity.
Calling, in itself, is an action; the outcome of the call is another
activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_37.jpg" />
</figure>

In this way, activities can be nested within each other and can be
represented with different levels of detail.

### Accepting an Event (Action)

This action waits for an event to occur. After the event is accepted,
the flow that comes from this action (and is defined in the activity
diagram) is executed. Accepting events is an important element for
business processes in activity diagrams:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_38.jpg" />
</figure>

Many business processes are initiated by events, for example, processing
an order by the receipt of an order, or delivery by the receipt of a
payment.

### Accepting a Time Event (Action)

At a definite point in time, this action starts a flow in the activity
diagram. An hourglass symbol can be used to represent the acceptance of
a time event:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_39.jpg" />
</figure>

A typical example of a time event is triggering reminders after the
deadline for payment has passed. We will discuss an example in
*[Modeling for System
Integration](/uml/modeling-for-system-integration)*.

### Sending Signals (Action)

Sending a signal means that a signal is being sent to an accepting
activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_40.jpg" />
</figure>

The accepting activity accepts the signal with the action "accepting an
event" and can react accordingly, meaning according to the flow that
originates from this node in the activity diagram.

### Edge (Control Flow)

Edges, represented by arrows, connect the individual components of
activity diagrams and illustrate the control flow of the activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_41.jpg" />
</figure>

Within the control flow an incoming arrow starts a single step of an
activity; after the step is completed the flow continues along the
outgoing arrow. A name can be attached to an edge (close to the arrow).

### Decision Node

The diamond below represents a conditional branch point or decision
node. A decision node has one input and two or more outputs:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_42.jpg" />
</figure>

Each output has a condition attached to it, which is written in
brackets. If a condition is met, the flow proceeds along the appropriate
output. An 'else' output can be defined along which the flow can proceed
if no other condition is met.

### Merge Node

The diamond below has several inputs and only one output:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_43.jpg" />
</figure>

Its purpose is the merging of flows. The inputs are not synchronized; if
a flow reaches such a node it proceeds at the output without waiting for
the arrival of other flows.

### Fork

For the branching of flows in two or more parallel flows we use a
synchronization bar, which is depicted as a thick horizontal or vertical
line:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_44.jpg" />
</figure>

Branching allows parallel flows within activities. A fork has one input
and two or more outputs.

### Join

For the consolidation of two or more parallel flows we also use a
synchronization bar, which is depicted as a thick horizontal or vertical
line:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_45.jpg" />
</figure>

During consolidation synchronization takes place, meaning the flow
proceeds only after *all* incoming flows have reached the consolidation
point. Join has two or more inputs and one output.

### Initial Node

The initial node is the starting point of an activity. An activity can
have more than one initial node; in this case several flows start at the
beginning of an activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_46.jpg" />
</figure>

It is also possible that an activity has no initial node, but is
initiated by an event (action: accepting an event).

### Activity Final Node

The activity final node indicates that an activity is completed. An
activity diagram can have more than one exit in the form of activity
final nodes:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_47.jpg" />
</figure>

If several parallel flows are present within an activity, all flows are
stopped at the time the activity final node is reached.

### Flow Final Node

A flow final node terminates a flow. Unlike the activity final node,
which ends an entire activity, reaching a flow final node has no effect
on other parallel flows that are being processed within the activity at
the same point in time:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_48.jpg" />
</figure>

In this way, parallel flows can be terminated individually and
selectively.

### Activity Partition

The individual elements of an activity diagram can be divided into
individual areas or 'partitions'. Various criteria can lead to the
creation of these partitions: organization entities, cost centers,
locations, etc:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_49.jpg" />
</figure>

Individual steps of an activity will be assigned to these partitions.
Each partition is set apart from its neighboring partition by a
horizontal or vertical continuous line; from this stems the term *swim
lanes*. Each partition receives a name. Partitions can be arranged in a
two-dimensional manner; in this case the activity diagram is divided
into individual cells like a grid.

## Reading Activity Diagrams

You start reading at the *initial node*, or in Figure 3.17 with the
acceptance of the event *passenger arrive at check-in* (1), and continue
along the arrows of the control flow (2). The subsequent action
*passenger checks in* (3) means that at this point the activity
*'passenger checks in'* is processed. This is depicted in more detail in
another activity diagram as is indicated by the 'fork' in the action
symbol:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_50.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.17 An activity diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

If you follow the control flow, next you will come to a conditional
branch or decision node (4): if the check-in is OK the next step along
the control flow can follow. Otherwise (5), the passenger cannot fly and
the task of passenger services is completed. This can be seen at the
black dot with border---the activity final node.

After successful check-in (7) you come to a black cross bar. All arrows
that come from this bar (7) symbolize flows that are processed
simultaneously. While the luggage is being loaded onto the airplane (9)
the passenger is boarding the airplane (10). Between point (8) and point
(11) the flows are independent from one another. At the second cross bar
(11) the simultaneously processed flows (9 and 10) are merged, meaning
that only when the passenger is on the plane (10) *and* the luggage has
been loaded onto the plane (9), does the control flow continue below the
cross bar (11). In our example, one more action (12) and subsequent to
that the final state (13) follow, meaning that after the passenger is on
the plane (10) and the luggage has been loaded onto the plane (9), the
airplane can taxi toward the runway (12). You can see here that the last
action airplane taxis toward runway (12) is only defined as a single
action, even though this process is very complex and could be described
in many other activity diagrams. In our context, however, it is not
important to describe this step in detail.

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_51.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.18 An activity diagram with partitions</figcaption>
</figure>

The activity diagram in Figure 3.18 is divided into two partitions:
*passenger* (1) and *passenger services* (2). The passenger, for
instance, carries out *showing ticket at check-in counter* (3),
*checking luggage* (4), and *paying fee* (i). All other actions are
located in the partition (swim lane) of passenger services (2) and are
carried out by passenger services.

# Activity Diagrams {#activity-diagrams-1 .title}




Activity diagrams, which are related to program flow plans (flowcharts),
are used to illustrate activities. In the external view, we use activity
diagrams for the description of those business processes that describe
the functionality of the business system.

Contrary to use case diagrams, in activity diagrams it is obvious
whether actors can perform business use cases together or independently
from one another.

Activity diagrams allow you to think functionally. Purists of the
object-oriented approach probably dislike this fact. We, on the other
hand, regard this fact as a great advantage, since users of
object-oriented methods, as well as users of functional thinking
patterns, find a common and familiar display format, which is a
significant aid for business-process modeling.

Because it is possible to explicitly describe parallel events, the
activity diagram is well suited for the illustration of business
processes, since business processes rarely occur in a linear manner and
often exhibit parallelisms.

Activity diagrams can be developed in various degrees of detail. They
can be refined step by step. In the external view, activity diagrams,
just like use case diagrams, exclusively represent business processes
and activities from the outside perspective. Refining diagrams does not
mean describing process details that are performed within the business
system, which often leads to an unnoticed shift to the internal view
(Figure 3.15):

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_33.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.15 Activity diagram “Passenger Services” with a low
level of detail (“High Level”)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_34.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.16 Activity diagram of the activity “Passenger
checks in”</figcaption>
</figure>

### Activity

An activity diagram illustrates one individual activity. In our context,
an activity represents a business process (Figure 3.16). Fundamental
elements of the activity are actions and control elements (decision,
division, merge, initiation, end, etc.):

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_35.jpg" />
</figure>

Elements are connected by so-called "activity edges" and form the
"control flow", which can also be casually called 'flow'. The execution
of an activity can contain parallel flows. A border can surround the
activity, meaning the entire activity diagram.

### Action

An action is an individual step within an activity, for example, a
calculation step that is not deconstructed any further. That does not
necessarily mean that the action cannot be subdivided in the real world,
but in this diagram will not be refined any further:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_36.jpg" />
</figure>

The action can possess input and output information The output of one
action can be the input of a subsequent action within an activity.
Specific actions are calling other actions, receiving an event, and
sending signals.

### Calling an Activity (Action)

With this symbol an activity can be called from within another activity.
Calling, in itself, is an action; the outcome of the call is another
activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_37.jpg" />
</figure>

In this way, activities can be nested within each other and can be
represented with different levels of detail.

### Accepting an Event (Action)

This action waits for an event to occur. After the event is accepted,
the flow that comes from this action (and is defined in the activity
diagram) is executed. Accepting events is an important element for
business processes in activity diagrams:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_38.jpg" />
</figure>

Many business processes are initiated by events, for example, processing
an order by the receipt of an order, or delivery by the receipt of a
payment.

### Accepting a Time Event (Action)

At a definite point in time, this action starts a flow in the activity
diagram. An hourglass symbol can be used to represent the acceptance of
a time event:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_39.jpg" />
</figure>

A typical example of a time event is triggering reminders after the
deadline for payment has passed. We will discuss an example in
*[Modeling for System
Integration](/uml/modeling-for-system-integration)*.

### Sending Signals (Action)

Sending a signal means that a signal is being sent to an accepting
activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_40.jpg" />
</figure>

The accepting activity accepts the signal with the action "accepting an
event" and can react accordingly, meaning according to the flow that
originates from this node in the activity diagram.

### Edge (Control Flow)

Edges, represented by arrows, connect the individual components of
activity diagrams and illustrate the control flow of the activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_41.jpg" />
</figure>

Within the control flow an incoming arrow starts a single step of an
activity; after the step is completed the flow continues along the
outgoing arrow. A name can be attached to an edge (close to the arrow).

### Decision Node

The diamond below represents a conditional branch point or decision
node. A decision node has one input and two or more outputs:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_42.jpg" />
</figure>

Each output has a condition attached to it, which is written in
brackets. If a condition is met, the flow proceeds along the appropriate
output. An 'else' output can be defined along which the flow can proceed
if no other condition is met.

### Merge Node

The diamond below has several inputs and only one output:

<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_43.jpg" />
</figure>

Its purpose is the merging of flows. The inputs are not synchronized; if
a flow reaches such a node it proceeds at the output without waiting for
the arrival of other flows.

### Fork

For the branching of flows in two or more parallel flows we use a
synchronization bar, which is depicted as a thick horizontal or vertical
line:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_44.jpg" />
</figure>

Branching allows parallel flows within activities. A fork has one input
and two or more outputs.

### Join

For the consolidation of two or more parallel flows we also use a
synchronization bar, which is depicted as a thick horizontal or vertical
line:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_45.jpg" />
</figure>

During consolidation synchronization takes place, meaning the flow
proceeds only after *all* incoming flows have reached the consolidation
point. Join has two or more inputs and one output.

### Initial Node

The initial node is the starting point of an activity. An activity can
have more than one initial node; in this case several flows start at the
beginning of an activity:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_46.jpg" />
</figure>

It is also possible that an activity has no initial node, but is
initiated by an event (action: accepting an event).

### Activity Final Node

The activity final node indicates that an activity is completed. An
activity diagram can have more than one exit in the form of activity
final nodes:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_47.jpg" />
</figure>

If several parallel flows are present within an activity, all flows are
stopped at the time the activity final node is reached.

### Flow Final Node

A flow final node terminates a flow. Unlike the activity final node,
which ends an entire activity, reaching a flow final node has no effect
on other parallel flows that are being processed within the activity at
the same point in time:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_48.jpg" />
</figure>

In this way, parallel flows can be terminated individually and
selectively.

### Activity Partition

The individual elements of an activity diagram can be divided into
individual areas or 'partitions'. Various criteria can lead to the
creation of these partitions: organization entities, cost centers,
locations, etc:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_49.jpg" />
</figure>

Individual steps of an activity will be assigned to these partitions.
Each partition is set apart from its neighboring partition by a
horizontal or vertical continuous line; from this stems the term *swim
lanes*. Each partition receives a name. Partitions can be arranged in a
two-dimensional manner; in this case the activity diagram is divided
into individual cells like a grid.

## Reading Activity Diagrams

You start reading at the *initial node*, or in Figure 3.17 with the
acceptance of the event *passenger arrive at check-in* (1), and continue
along the arrows of the control flow (2). The subsequent action
*passenger checks in* (3) means that at this point the activity
*'passenger checks in'* is processed. This is depicted in more detail in
another activity diagram as is indicated by the 'fork' in the action
symbol:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_50.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.17 An activity diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

If you follow the control flow, next you will come to a conditional
branch or decision node (4): if the check-in is OK the next step along
the control flow can follow. Otherwise (5), the passenger cannot fly and
the task of passenger services is completed. This can be seen at the
black dot with border---the activity final node.

After successful check-in (7) you come to a black cross bar. All arrows
that come from this bar (7) symbolize flows that are processed
simultaneously. While the luggage is being loaded onto the airplane (9)
the passenger is boarding the airplane (10). Between point (8) and point
(11) the flows are independent from one another. At the second cross bar
(11) the simultaneously processed flows (9 and 10) are merged, meaning
that only when the passenger is on the plane (10) *and* the luggage has
been loaded onto the plane (9), does the control flow continue below the
cross bar (11). In our example, one more action (12) and subsequent to
that the final state (13) follow, meaning that after the passenger is on
the plane (10) and the luggage has been loaded onto the plane (9), the
airplane can taxi toward the runway (12). You can see here that the last
action airplane taxis toward runway (12) is only defined as a single
action, even though this process is very complex and could be described
in many other activity diagrams. In our context, however, it is not
important to describe this step in detail.

<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_51.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.18 An activity diagram with partitions</figcaption>
</figure>

The activity diagram in Figure 3.18 is divided into two partitions:
*passenger* (1) and *passenger services* (2). The passenger, for
instance, carries out *showing ticket at check-in counter* (3),
*checking luggage* (4), and *paying fee* (i). All other actions are
located in the partition (swim lane) of passenger services (2) and are
carried out by passenger services.
